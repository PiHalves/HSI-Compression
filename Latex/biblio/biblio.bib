This creates major challenges for data transmission and storage, making hyperspectral image compression a crucial area of research. Compression techniques can be either lossy or lossless, each employing distinct strategies to maximize efficiency. To provide a more focused and comprehensive analysis, this review concentrates exclusively on lossless compression, which is categorized into transform, prediction, and deep learning-based methods. Each category is systematically examined, with particular emphasis on the underlying principles and the strategies adopted to enhance compression performance. In addition to the core algorithms, encoding and scanning orders are also discussed, which is an essential aspect that is often overlooked in other reviews. By integrating these aspects into a unified framework, this paper offers an up-to-date and in-depth overview of the methodologies, trends, and challenges in lossless hyperspectral image compression.},

Applying chemometrics to environmental data allows us to identify and describe the inter-relationship of environmental drivers{,} sources of contamination{,} and their potential impact upon the environment. This review aims to provide a detailed understanding of chemometric techniques{,} how they are currently used in environmental monitoring{,} and how these techniques can be used to improve current practices.

  abstract       = {Traditional imagery—provided, for example, by RGB and/or NIR sensors—has proven to be useful in many agroforestry applications. However, it lacks the spectral range and precision to profile materials and organisms that only hyperspectral sensors can provide. This kind of high-resolution spectroscopy was firstly used in satellites and later in manned aircraft, which are significantly expensive platforms and extremely restrictive due to availability limitations and/or complex logistics. More recently, UAS have emerged as a very popular and cost-effective remote sensing technology, composed of aerial platforms capable of carrying small-sized and lightweight sensors. Meanwhile, hyperspectral technology developments have been consistently resulting in smaller and lighter sensors that can currently be integrated in UAS for either scientific or commercial purposes. The hyperspectral sensors’ ability for measuring hundreds of bands raises complexity when considering the sheer quantity of acquired data, whose usefulness depends on both calibration and corrective tasks occurring in pre- and post-flight stages. Further steps regarding hyperspectral data processing must be performed towards the retrieval of relevant information, which provides the true benefits for assertive interventions in agricultural crops and forested areas. Considering the aforementioned topics and the goal of providing a global view focused on hyperspectral-based remote sensing supported by UAV platforms, a survey including hyperspectral sensors, inherent data processing and applications focusing both on agriculture and forestry—wherein the combination of UAV and hyperspectral sensors plays a center role—is presented in this paper. Firstly, the advantages of hyperspectral data over RGB imagery and multispectral data are highlighted. Then, hyperspectral acquisition devices are addressed, including sensor types, acquisition modes and UAV-compatible sensors that can be used for both research and commercial purposes. Pre-flight operations and post-flight pre-processing are pointed out as necessary to ensure the usefulness of hyperspectral data for further processing towards the retrieval of conclusive information. With the goal of simplifying hyperspectral data processing—by isolating the common user from the processes’ mathematical complexity—several available toolboxes that allow a direct access to level-one hyperspectral data are presented. Moreover, research works focusing the symbiosis between UAV-hyperspectral for agriculture and forestry applications are reviewed, just before the paper’s conclusions.},

  abstract = {Geologists have used remote sensing data since the advent of the technology for regional mapping, structural interpretation and to aid in prospecting for ores and hydrocarbons. This paper provides a review of multispectral and hyperspectral remote sensing data, products and applications in geology. During the early days of Landsat Multispectral scanner and Thematic Mapper, geologists developed band ratio techniques and selective principal component analysis to produce iron oxide and hydroxyl images that could be related to hydrothermal alteration. The advent of the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflectance Radiometer (ASTER) with six channels in the shortwave infrared and five channels in the thermal region allowed to produce qualitative surface mineral maps of clay minerals (kaolinite, illite), sulfate minerals (alunite), carbonate minerals (calcite, dolomite), iron oxides (hematite, goethite), and silica (quartz) which allowed to map alteration facies (propylitic, argillic etc.). The step toward quantitative and validated (subpixel) surface mineralogic mapping was made with the advent of high spectral resolution hyperspectral remote sensing. This led to a wealth of techniques to match image pixel spectra to library and field spectra and to unravel mixed pixel spectra to pure endmember spectra to derive subpixel surface compositional information. These products have found their way to the mining industry and are to a lesser extent taken up by the oil and gas sector. The main threat for geologic remote sensing lies in the lack of (satellite) data continuity. There is however a unique opportunity to develop standardized protocols leading to validated and reproducible products from satellite remote sensing for the geology community. By focusing on geologic mapping products such as mineral and lithologic maps, geochemistry, P-T paths, fluid pathways etc. the geologic remote sensing community can bridge the gap with the geosciences community. Increasingly workflows should be multidisciplinary and remote sensing data should be integrated with field observations and subsurface geophysical data to monitor and understand geologic processes.}

  abstract = {The tasks of storing and transmitting hyperspectral images (HSIs) face challenges due to the extensive number of present bands. The recovery of HSIs at extremely low compression ratios represents a significant challenge in hyperspectral applications. To address these challenges, we propose a CNN-transformer mixture (CTM) architecture-based compressed sensing network (CTCSN). Its core feature enhancement backbone network incorporates a multilayer CTM module and is integrated with a spatial-spectral superresolution (SR) decoder module; this network aims to surmount the challenges posed by traditional compressed sensing (CS) technology in terms of reconstructing HSIs. Furthermore, to satisfy the receptive field requirements of strip data acquired from spaceborne push-broom hyperspectral sensors, we employ nonsquare convolutional layers and CTM-like blocks to devise a lightweight encoder. Overall, our approach, which is grounded in deep learning (DL), achieves significantly improved reconstruction quality and efficiency by merging the local modeling capabilities of a convolutional neural network (CNN) with the global information processing prowess of a transformer. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to the recently proposed deep CS network (DCSN) and bit-level tensor data compression network (BTC-Net) (32-bit) methods, our method achieves an average SAM improvement of approximately 10% at a sampling rate of 1%, confirming its superiority in the field of CS for HSIs.

  abstract = {Sparse representation (SR) can transform spectral signatures of hyperspectral pixels into sparse coefficients with very few nonzero entries, which can efficiently be used for compression. In this paper, a spectral-spatial adaptive SR (SSASR) method is proposed for hyperspectral image (HSI) compression by taking advantage of the spectral and spatial information of HSIs. First, we construct superpixels, i.e., homogeneous regions with adaptive sizes and shapes, to describe HSIs. Since homogeneous regions usually consist of similar pixels, pixels within each superpixel will be similar and share similar spectral signatures. Then, the spectral signatures of each superpixel can be simultaneously coded in the SR model to exploit their joint sparsity. Since different superpixels generally have different performances of SR, their rate-distortion performances in the sparse coding will be different. To achieve the best possible overall rate-distortion performance, an adaptive coding scheme is introduced to adaptively assign distortions to superpixels. Finally, the obtained sparse coefficients are quantized and entropy coded and constitute the final bitstream with the coded superpixel map. The experimental results over several HSIs show that the proposed SSASR method outperforms some state-of-the-art HSI compression methods in terms of the rate-distortion and spectral fidelity performances.},

  abstract       = {Two key hurdles to the adoption of Machine Learning (ML) techniques in hyperspectral data compression are computational complexity and scalability for large numbers of bands. These are due to the limited computing capacity available in remote sensing platforms and the high computational cost of compression algorithms for hyperspectral data, especially when the number of bands is large. To address these issues, a channel clusterisation strategy is proposed, which reduces the computational demands of learned compression methods for real scenarios and is scalable for different sources of data with varying numbers of bands. The proposed method is compatible with an embedded implementation for state-of-the-art on board hardware, a first for a ML hyperspectral data compression method. In terms of coding performance, our proposal surpasses established lossy methods such as JPEG 2000 preceded by a spectral Karhunen-Loève Transform (KLT), in clusters of 3 to 7 bands, achieving a PSNR improvement of, on average, 9 dB for AVIRIS and 3 dB for Hyperion images.},

  abstract  = {Transformers have revolutionized almost all natural language processing (NLP) tasks but suffer from memory and computational complexity that scales quadratically with sequence length. In contrast, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) exhibit linear scaling in memory and computational requirements but struggle to match the same performance as Transformers due to limitations in parallelization and scalability. We propose a novel model architecture, Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV), that combines the efficient parallelizable training of transformers with the efficient inference of RNNs. Our approach leverages a linear attention mechanism and allows us to formulate the model as either a Transformer or an RNN, thus parallelizing computations during training and maintains constant computational and memory complexity during inference. We scale our models as large as 14 billion parameters, by far the largest dense RNN ever trained, and find RWKV performs on par with similarly sized Transformers, suggesting future work can leverage this architecture to create more efficient models. This work presents a significant step towards reconciling trade-offs between computational efficiency and model performance in sequence processing tasks.}

  abstract = {Methane is the second most important greenhouse gas contributor to climate change; at the same time its reduction has been denoted as one of the fastest pathways to preventing temperature growth due to its short atmospheric lifetime. In particular, the mitigation of active point-sources associated with the fossil fuel industry has a strong and cost-effective mitigation potential. Detection of methane plumes in remote sensing data is possible, but the existing approaches exhibit high false positive rates and need manual intervention. Machine learning research in this area is limited due to the lack of large real-world annotated datasets. In this work, we are publicly releasing a machine learning ready dataset with manually refined annotation of methane plumes. We present labelled hyperspectral data from the AVIRIS-NG sensor and provide simulated multispectral WorldView-3 views of the same data to allow for model benchmarking across hyperspectral and multispectral sensors. We propose sensor agnostic machine learning architectures, using classical methane enhancement products as input features. Our HyperSTARCOP model outperforms strong matched filter baseline by over 25{\%} in F1 score, while reducing its false positive rate per classified tile by over 41.83{\%}. Additionally, we demonstrate zero-shot generalisation of our trained model on data from the EMIT hyperspectral instrument, despite the differences in the spectral and spatial resolution between the two sensors: in an annotated subset of EMIT images HyperSTARCOP achieves a 40{\%} gain in F1 score over the baseline.},

  abstract       = {This research paper presents novel condensed CNN architecture for the recognition of multispectral images, which has been developed to address the lack of attention paid to neural network designs for multispectral and hyperspectral photography in comparison to RGB photographs. The proposed architecture is able to recognize 10-band multispectral images and has fewer parameters than popular deep designs, such as ResNet and DenseNet, thanks to recent advancements in more efficient smaller CNNs. The proposed architecture is trained from scratch, and it outperforms a comparable network that was trained on RGB images in terms of accuracy and efficiency. The study also demonstrates the use of a Bayesian variant of CNN architecture to show that a network able to process multispectral information greatly reduces the uncertainty associated with class predictions in comparison to standard RGB images. The results of the study are demonstrated by comparing the accuracy of the network’s predictions to the images.},
